This is the first project I ever made in Java. I created it right after I learned Java. It is a simple game, and you can play against an algorithm I made and see if you can beat it. 
To my knowledge there are 2 ways you can beat it, but there could be more I am unaware of. It is pretty simple, but is my first use of Object Oriented Programming.
